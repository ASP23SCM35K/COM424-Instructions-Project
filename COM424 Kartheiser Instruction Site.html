		When using electrical appliances, basic safety precautions should always be followed to reduce the risk of fire, electric shock, and injury to persons, including the following:
		Read all instructions before using the appliance. 
		To avoid fire or shock hazard, plug the appliance directly into a 120V AC electrical outlet.
		Keep the cord out of heavy traffic areas. To avoid fire hazard, NEVER put the plug under rugs or near hear registers.
		DO NOT place humidifier near heat sources such as stoves, radiators, and heaters. DO locate your humidifier on an inside wall near an electrical outlet. The humidifier should be at least 4 inches (10cm) away from the wall for best results.
		NEVER place humidifier in an area where it is accessible to children. NEVER use humidifier in a closed room, particularly where a child may be sleeping, resting, or playing (a closed room may result in excessive humidity).
		WARNING: Do not attempt to refill humidifier without first unplugging the unit from its electrical outlet. Failure to heed this warning may cause personal injury. Be sure to unplug the unit by pulling on the plug and not the cord.
		Never place anything over moisture outlet while the unit is running.
		NEVER drop or insert any object into any openings.
		DO NOT operate any appliance with a damaged cord or plug, after the appliance malfunctions, or if it has been dropped or damaged in any manner. Return appliance to manufacturer for examination, electrical or mechanical adjustment, or repair.
		Use appliance only for intended household use as described in this manual. Any other use not recommended by the manufacturer may cause fire, electric shock, or injury to persons. Attachments not recommended or sold by the manufacturer may cause hazards.
		DO NOT use outdoors.
		Always place humidifier on a firm, flat, level surface. A waterproof mat or pad is recommended for use under the humidifier. NEVER place it on a rug or carpet, or on a finished floor that may be damaged by exposure to water or moisture.
		DO NOT allow the moisture outlet to directly face the wall. Moisture could cause damage, particularly to wall paper.
		Humidifier should be unplugged when not in use.
		NEVER tilt, move, or attempt to empty unit while it is operating. Shut off and unplug before removing the water tank and moving the unit.
		This humidifier requires daily and weekly maintenance to operate appropriately. Refer to daily and weekly cleaning procedures. Use only cleaners and additives recommended by the manufacturer.
		NEVER use detergents, gasoline, glass cleaner, furniture polish, paint thinner, or other household solvents to clean any part of the humidifier.
		Excessive humidity in a room can cause water condensation on windows and some furniture. If this happens, turn the humidifier OFF.
		Do not use humidifier in an area where humidity level is in excess of 50%. Use a hygrometer, available at your local retailer or through the manufacturer, to measure the humidity.
		DO NOT attempt to repair or adjust any electrical or mechanical functions on this unit. Doing so will void your warranty. The inside of the unit contains no user serviceable parts. All servicing should be performed by qualified personnel only.
		Never place housing under water flow or immerse in liquids.
		Do not plug in the cord with wet hands: electric shock could result.
		Do not pour water in any openings other than the water tank.
		To prevent damage to surfaces, do not place humidifier under overhanging surfaces.
		NEVER operate unit without water in the tank.
		Do not move unit after it has been used until unit cools completely.
		Use both hands when carrying full tank of water.

		THIS APPLIANCE HAS A POLARIZED PLUG (one blade is wider than the other). To reduce the risk of electric shock, this plug is intended to fit in a polarized outlet only one way. If the plug does not fit fully in the outlet, reverse the plug. If it still does not fit, contact a qualified electrician to install the proper outlet.
		DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MODIFY THIS PLUG OR DEFEAT THIS SAFETY FEATURE IN ANY WAY.

		PLEASE READ AND SAVE THESE IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS
		CONSUMER SAFETY INFORMATION
		NOTE: This is an electrical appliance and requires attention when in use.
		NOTE: If moisture forms on walls or windows of the room, turn off the humidifier. The room already has plenty of humidity and additional moisture may cause damage.
		NOTE: DO NOT block air inlet or outlet.
		Cord and Plug Installation Safety Instructions:
		The length of cord used on this appliance was selected to reduce the hazards of becoming tangled in, or tripping over a longer cord. If a longer cord is necessary an approved extension cord may be used. The electrical rating of the extension cord must be equal to or greater than the rating of the humidifier (refer to the rating information placed on the humidifier). Care must be take to arrange the extension cord so that it will not drape over the countertop or tabletop where it can be pulled on by children or accidentally tripped over.
