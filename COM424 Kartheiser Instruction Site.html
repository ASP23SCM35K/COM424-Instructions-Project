		<ol>
			<li>Only use appliance for intended household use as described in this manual. Any other use not recommended by the manufacturer may cause fire, electric shock, or injury to persons. Attachments not recommended or sold by the manufacturer may also cause hazards.</li>
			<li>DO NOT operate any appliance with a damaged cord or plug, after the appliance malfunctions, or if it has been dropped or damaged in any manner. Return appliance to manufacturer for examination, electrical or mechanical adjustment, or repair. DO NOT attempt to repair or adjust any electrical or mechanical functions on this unit. Doing so will void your warranty. The inside of the unit contains no user serviceable parts. All servicing should be performed by qualified personnel only.</li>
			<li>This humidifier requires daily and weekly maintenance to operate appropriately. Refer to daily and weekly cleaning procedures. Use only cleaners and additives recommended by the manufacturer. NEVER use detergents, gasoline, glass cleaner, furniture polish, paint thinner, or other household solvents to clean any part of the humidifier.</li>
			<li>Never place housing outdoors, under water flow, or immersed in liquids. Always place humidifier on an inside wall near an electrical outlet on a firm, flat, level surface. A waterproof mat or pad is recommended for use under the humidifier.</li>
			<li>DO NOT place humidifier near heat sources such as stoves, radiators, and heaters. The humidifier should be at least 4 inches (10cm) away from the wall for best results.</li>
			<li>NEVER place humidifier in an area where it is accessible to children or use humidifier in a closed room (a closed room may result in excessive humidity).</li>
			<li>To prevent damage to surfaces, do not place humidifier under overhanging surfaces, on a rug or carpet, or on a finished floor that may be damaged by exposure to water or moisture.</li>
			<li>NEVER allow the moisture outlet to directly face the wall. Moisture could cause damage, particularly to wall paper.</li>
			<li>Do not use humidifier in an area where humidity level is in excess of 50% (Excessive humidity in a room can cause water condensation on windows and some furniture). Use a hygrometer, available at your local retailer or through the manufacturer, to measure the humidity.</li>
			<li>Humidifier should be unplugged when not in use and should NEVER be operated without water in the tank (Take care and use both hands when carrying full tank of water).</li>
			<li>Do not attempt to refill or empty humidifier without first unplugging the unit from its electrical outlet (Be sure to unplug the unit by pulling on the plug and not the cord).</li>
			<li>NEVER tilt, move, or place anything over moisture inlet or outlet while it is operating or before it has completely cooled off. Shut off and unplug before removing the water tank and moving the unit.</li>
			<li>NEVER drop, insert, or pour anything into any openings. Only pour water into the water tank.</li>
			<li>Do not plug in the cord with wet hands: electric shock could result.</li>
			<li>Keep the cord out of heavy traffic areas. To avoid fire hazard, plug the appliance directly into a 120V AC electrical outlet and NEVER put the plug under rugs or near heat registers.</li>
			<li>THIS APPLIANCE HAS A POLARIZED PLUG (one blade is wider than the other). To reduce the risk of electric shock, this plug is intended to fit in a polarized outlet only one way. If the plug does not fit fully in the outlet, reverse the plug. If it still does not fit, contact a qualified electrician to install the proper outlet. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MODIFY THIS PLUG OR DEFEAT THIS SAFETY FEATURE IN ANY WAY.</li>
